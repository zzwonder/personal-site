So, I decided to create a blog. And rather than building something from Wordpress, Squarespace, Devpost, Gatsby, or Medium, I wanted to build my own from scratch. And so, here I am, hacking away at something that won't immediately scale, but will hopefully help me grow as an engineer. I plan to explore my thoughts, concepts, (often silly) ideas, and share parts of my journey as I learn. Instead of boring you with more text. Here's an example of the type of things you can expect in future posts.
